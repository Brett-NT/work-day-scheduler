# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

This page is designed to act as a daily task scheduler. There are time blocks set from 9AM until 5pm. Hours that have passed will be grey, the current hour will be highlighted in red, and the hours of the day yet to happen will be highlighted in green. You can enter a task to be completed in each hour, and press the blue button to the right in order to save the tasks written in the time slots.
